This repository involved understanding COVID-19 data obtained from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The CDC collected de-identified patient data including COVID severity indicators, outcomes, clinical data and laboratory test results. This dataset was then cleaned and the following tasks were completed:

1. Data quality report of the original dataset.
2. Data quality plan for the cleaned dataset.
3. Explore Relationships between feature pairs.
4. Transform the existing features to create new features with the aim to better capture the problem domain and the target outcome.
